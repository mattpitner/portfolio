          <p>My name is Matt Pitner and I was born and raised in Denver Colorado. I am currently enrolled in the Full Stack Web Development program
            at Denver University. My interest in programming/computers started while I was in Highschool. I went through Thomas Jeffersons Computer Magnet program 
            and learned the basics of programming. After studying music at various colleges and working as a technician at Honda, I decided it was time for me
            to take my education the the next level and start my programming career. After learning basic HTML, CSS and Javascript online through various
            websites and resources I started looking into bootcamps. The DU full stack program stuck out to me because it seemed to cover a lot of content
            which is just what I need to start my foundation in programming. 
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>Although the program is fast paced and daunting at times, I still feel like I am learning a ton and expanding my knowledge on programming
            immensley. My instructor and all TA's have been very helpful and supportive throughout the course. I still have a lot to learn 
            and look forward to continuing my knowledge in computer programming.
